        "In this blog post, I was hoping to look into using Machine Learning to make a prediction system. In particular, I was hoping to imitate ones used for stock prediction. However, since there were too many tutorials on this topic, I decided to investigate into another global, financial factor that governs trade internationally: international currency rates. In the news recently, I have heard rumors of how the international standard of utilizing the US dollar could be compromised with other global powers such as China and India rise in global dominance. Thus, I focused my efforts on analyzing the US currency conversion rates to other countries. With that said, let's try to analyze this topic with some Machine Learning:\n",

        "## Conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "- Returning to my attempt to test the ability for my Machine Learning model to predict the International Currency rates for Austrailia from just the range of my training dataset as shown above, I felt that its prediction was acceptable in my opinion giving the averaging across the currency rate values in my validation and testing datasets would have proven to be considerably close in its precision. \n",
        "\n",
        "- Thus, I reached the conclusion that my International Currency Predictor would not be a viable Machine Learning model for any real-life applications. This Machine Learning model raised a valuable point - financial market prediction is a difficult endeavor to accurately predict. From a more general point of view, this International Currency Maching Learning prediction model is not totally inaccurate or untrustworthy but rather it is only on the micro-scale. These financial predictions do not always account for current events in that respective country such as changing domestic or international relations or constantly changing socioeconomic trends which could significantly sway market confidence and impact currency rate fluctuation. Consequently, economists often have to look at larger economic trends across several decades in order to make more educated predictions. \n",
        "\n",
        "- Ultimately, I learned a great deal about the complexities of financial prediction and usage of Machine Learning models as an attempt to solve this issue. Even though my model was not as successful at predicting as I would have hoped, I am interested to see the future of Machine Learning as it soon dominates these economic sub-field and  continues to rise in its relevance by being a pivotal talking point for the future and applied soon enough to other sectors of our society. \n",
